## One-Sentence Summary

By performing SiT, scRNA-seq and TCR analysis of tumor and LN, we identified that temporal heterogeneity of spatial CD74 isoform reveals the expand colocalization of C1QC+ TAMs and CD8+ CXCL13+ Tex cells in LN metastasis of ESCC.  The CD74 isoform may be targeted to block this interaction and prevent metastasis and chemoresistance in ESCC.


## Abstract

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), lymph node (LN) metastasis is associated with poor survival. Emerging evidence demonstrates elevated CD8+ T cell levels in metastatic LNs following immunotherapy and increasing chemoresistance. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of CD8+ T cells in chemoresistant/metastatic patients remain unclear. Since metastasis is associated with aberrant splicing patterns, transcripts with alternative splice forms also play a critical role. With spatial transcriptomics (ST), spatial isoform transcriptomics (SiT), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and TCR, this study analyzed the spatial isoform quantitatively in human solid tumors and LN. Isoforms is classified by expression pattern and spatial distribution pattern and proposes the temporal heterogeneity in ribosome protein isoforms attributed to ribosomal biogenesis dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that CD8+ CXCL13+ exhausted T cell (Tex) ratio increases in metastatic LNs in ESCC after chemotherapy.  C1QC+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to the formation of metastases in the context of both immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Additionally, the CD74 isoforms can be targeted by mRNA drugs, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA interference (RNAi), to prevent chemoresistance and metastasis. Overall, our work suggests that C1QC+ TAMs promote metastasis by interacting with CD8+ CXCL13+ Tex cells via colocalization with the CD74 isoform in ESCC.
